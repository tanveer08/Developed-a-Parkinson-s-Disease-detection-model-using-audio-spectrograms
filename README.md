1. Converted 42 audio signals to Frequency Transforms to store spectrum information as 1952 images data-set
2. Comparative Analysis of Transfer Learning with CNNs & ViTs to extract features from Wavelet Transforms
3. Trained multiple classifiers and Optimized hyperparameters via 5-fold cross-validation and GridSearchCV
